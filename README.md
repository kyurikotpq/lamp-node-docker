# LAMP + NodeJS Stack in Docker

> This builds upon my previous work for [sshftp](https://github.com/kyurikotpq/sshftp).

This time, I wanted something that's more for personal use:
- Host Specs: Docker Desktop running on Macbook Air M1
- Container Specs:
    - Alpine Linux 3.15, PHP 8, Apache, MariaDB, Composer
    - Nodejs + NPM, PM2
